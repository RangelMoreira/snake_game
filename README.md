# Snake Game


# About the project

Classic game from old Nokia cell phones, now developed in Python using the Turtle library.
In this game, we control a snake that goes after apples and, with each apple eaten, the snake grows in size and one point is added to the score.

If the snake collides with the edges of the screen or with itself, the game ends.

The highest score will be recorded in a txt file.
